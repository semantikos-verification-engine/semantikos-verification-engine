# SEMANTIKOS: The Verification Layer for AI Trust

**"Fluency is not Truth."**

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are designed for prediction, not verification. This leads to the **Trust Crisis**: hallucinations, lack of grounding, and opaque decision-making that prevent AI adoption in mission-critical industries.

**SEMANTIKOS** solves this by separating **Generation** from **Verification**. We provide a modular "Layered Ring" architecture that plugs into any existing AI (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) to ensure every output is mathematically and logically grounded.

## 🚀 The Hybrid Architecture (Phase 1)

This repository contains the core middleware for the **SEMANTIKOS Verification Engine**. It implements a series of concentric rings that an AI response must pass through before being deemed "Verified."

### The Layered Rings:
* **Ring 1: Grounding (No-Leap Constraint):** Ensures every token generated is anchored to a verified source.
* **Ring 2: Semantic Logic:** Translates natural language into the **Semantikos Formula Framework** to check for internal contradictions.
* **Ring 3: Audit Trail:** Generates a cryptographic hash of the verification process for full traceability.
* **Ring 4: Attestation (Enterprise Only):** Provides a signed certificate of compliance for regulatory requirements.

## ⚖️ Licensing & Ownership

SEMANTIKOS is committed to the open-source community while protecting our core intellectual property.

* **Open Source Core:** This middleware is licensed under the **GNU GPL v3**. If you build on this core, your modifications must remain open.
* **Commercial & Enterprise:** For organizations requiring a proprietary license or access to our advanced **Semantic Formula Framework** (Phase 2 & 3), please contact our team.

## 💼 Commercial Licensing & Partnerships

While the **SEMANTIKOS Core** is open-source under GPL v3, we provide specialized solutions for enterprise partners:

* **Commercial Licensing:** For organizations that wish to integrate the Semantikos Verification Engine into proprietary, "closed-source" software.
* **Phase 2 Access:** Access to the advanced **Semantic Formula Framework** for complex logical verification.
* **Custom Integration:** Professional services to map our "Layered Rings" to your specific industry data (Legal, Healthcare, Finance).

**For inquiries regarding commercial use or design partnerships, please contact:**
SEMANTIKOS4267@proton.me



## ⚖️ Commercial & Hardware Licensing (AICS Chip)

The **SEMANTIKOS Verification Engine** is offered under a dual-licensing model to accommodate both open-source innovation and industrial-scale hardware deployment.

### 1. Open Source (GPL v3)
The core software logic is provided for public audit and non-commercial academic use. Any derivative works must remain open-source under the same terms.

### 2. Enterprise & Hardware Partnership (Proprietary)
The **AICS (Architectural Intelligence Consciousness System) Chip** architecture and Phase 2/3 native generation engines are **PATENT PENDING** and are NOT covered by the GPL v3 license. Commercial use, silicon integration, or "closed-source" deployment requires a separate **Commercial License Agreement**.

**Strategic Partnership Opportunities for Semiconductor Firms (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, ARM):**
We are currently seeking 3-5 Tier-1 Design Partners for the AICS Alpha program.
* **IP Licensing:** Integration of Semantikos verification logic into existing GPU/TPU pipelines.
* **Custom Silicon:** Collaborative development of the standalone AICS verification chip.
* **Verification-as-a-Service:** Cloud-level hardware-enforced truth for enterprise LLM clusters.

**For Partnership & Licensing Inquiries:**
Don't hesitate to get in touch with Gregory Hernandez (Founder) at: * SEMANTIKOS4267@proton.me *
*A Mutual NDA is required for access to unredacted hardware specifications.*
